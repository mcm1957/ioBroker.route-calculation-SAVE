## route-calculation adapter for ioBroker
This Adapter uses the HERE.com API version 8 to check the traffic on your routes. This adapter is a fork of https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.roadtraffic. 
You can configure multiple routes and the adapter will check the actual traffic situation and show you how long your journey will take.
The Adapter has an alarm clock - so you can tell the Adapter at which time you have to be at work - and the Adapter starts playing Radio and makes an announcement on Alexa (Alexa2 Adapter required) - or you can use your own script to react on the alarm of the adapter..


## Getting started
So lets go:
1. Go to https://platform.here.com/sign-up and create a HERE.com Free Account (Freemium). You donÂ´t need to enable billing so you can skip the billing information.

2. Look for the REST Section and click on "Generate App". You can generate new keys as well in the Access Manager.

3. Open the Instancesettings of the roadtraffic Adapter in ioBroker and paste the API Key into the config field.

4. Click the Plus icon in the Instance-Settings and create your first Route..

After you entered all informations to the config dialog click "Save & Close".
The Adapter should now restart and you are ready to go!
